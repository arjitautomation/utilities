zookeeper should be running first

zookeeper-server-start.sh -> it uses config file located under config/zookeeper.properties
kafka-server-start.sh -> Used to start kafka server (it uses config file located in config/server.properties)


## Creating topic

bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic cities

when we create a topic, the messages are stored in that topic, the location of topic's messages can be found in server.properties. you may notice
cities-0 as the folder because we have only created a single partitions, even the partition number is also defined in server.properties.
cd /tmp/kafka-logs 
arjitsrivastava@ARJITs-MacBook-Air kafka-logs % ls
cities-0                                log-st
